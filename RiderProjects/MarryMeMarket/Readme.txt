MarryMe Market

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for MarryMe Market, a tech startup aimed at revolutionizing the wedding industry by connecting people who own wedding-related items—such as venues, dresses, and decor—to individuals seeking affordable rental options.

🌟 What We're About

Weddings are expensive. Why buy everything outright when you can rent beautiful, pre-loved wedding essentials at a fraction of the cost? MarryMe Market creates a seamless platform for both sellers and renters, helping everyone save money and reduce waste.

🎯 Key Features

Landing Page: A welcoming and informative overview explaining our mission to reduce wedding costs through sustainable rentals.

Seller Sign-Up: Allows individuals to list wedding items—venues, dresses, decor—that they own and want to rent out.

Product Gallery: Showcases available rental items, making it easy for users to browse and find exactly what they need for their special day.
